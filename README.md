# Prediction of Occurrence of Circuit-breakers in Stock Prices using Machine Learning
---
### Abstract <br>

Stock markets have always been profitable investment options with excellent potential for wealth generation. The crashes in stocks can dislocate economic activities and disastrously affect the investors whose income and wealth are based on these financial assets. To curb the extreme price fluctuations that occur due to panic selling or buying of stocks, circuit breakers are administered to particular stocks or indices. Circuit breakers temporarily halt trading when a stock price breaches prescribed limits.

Predicting the circuit a few seconds before the surge or decline is not beneficial as it will not provide the investors enough time to take necessary actions; hence a trading algorithm is needed to predict this kind of disruption well before it occurs. The non-linear and random behaviour of stock prices requires machine learning methods to develop an efficient trading algorithm. The first measure is to cluster the stocks into disruptive and non-disruptive based on the occurrence of past circuits, which is followed by the identification of characteristics that affect the share prices. Subsequently, we will prove how mathematical models fail to capture the stock volatility and finally move towards using machine learning as the foundation for the trading algorithm.

### Tangible Outputs <br>
The disruption in stocks can be tested using a wide range of algorithms. <br>
•	Data collation and pre-processing <br>
•	Classification of a stock as disruptive or non-disruptive based on past circuits. <br>
•	Performing exploratory data analysis and identification of the parameters that disrupt stock prices and lead to circuits. <br>
•	Developing a trading algorithm to predict circuits in a disruptive stock as early as possible. <br>
•	An additional outcome will be a comparison of different trading algorithms to find the most efficient algorithm. <br>
